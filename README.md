# TravelTrucks - Camper Rental Web Application

## Project Description

TravelTrucks is an innovative web application created for "TravelTrucks," a company specializing in camper rentals. Our goal is to provide users with a convenient and intuitive interface for searching and booking campers that meet their needs. With TravelTrucks, you can easily find the perfect camper for your next adventure!

## Key Features

- **Vehicle Filtering:** Users can filter campers by location, body type, and the availability of various amenities such as air conditioning, kitchen, and other criteria.
- **Favorites List:** Users can add campers to a favorites list, which is saved even after refreshing the page, allowing for easy return to their selection.
- **User Reviews:** Each camper's page displays reviews from other users who rate the camper on a five-star scale, helping to make an informed choice.
- **Booking Form:** Users can book a camper by filling out a simple form. After successfully submitting the form, a notification of successful booking appears.
- **Detailed Camper Description:** Each camper has its own page with a detailed description, a photo gallery, user reviews, and a booking form. The description includes features such as transmission, engine, air conditioning, bathroom, kitchen, TV, radio, refrigerator, microwave, gas, and water, as well as details like form, length, width, height, tank capacity, and fuel consumption.
